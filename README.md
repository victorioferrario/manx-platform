# HUBX-PLATFORM
This repository is an experimentation in creating a very sophisticated application eco-system, but put together in a way that teams of all sizes and skill sets can collaborate with in the same repository.  This is the main montivation in extracting the services and core layout modules.  A front-end developer has no business creating services or sophisticated models.  They need to just have a reliable and pre-wired up framework, and let them focus on what they do best.
